# UWLibCatProfiles
Profiles for RDA cataloging in Sinopia, being developed locally at the University of Washington for use in the LD4P2 project. 

We are trying a new strategy, creating profiles for BIBFRAME/BFLC and RDA, respectively, and using scripts to generate format-specific profiles for RDA cataloging from those larger profiles. We also plan to publish our data as BIBFRAME and link to it from the RDA data.
