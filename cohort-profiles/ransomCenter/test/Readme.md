# Ransom Center test profiles

This directory includes HRC profiles created for testing purposes. 

>Files that include the sufix **_v0.1.0** have been validated against the JSON schemas v0.1.0.


#### HRC ARM Monograph Binding test
*High level JSON profile test for the ARM Binding model. Some of the RTs included here should probably defined outside of this profile on its own.*

#### HRC ARM Monograph Custodial History test
*High level JSON profile test for the ARM Custodial History model. It doesn't include price, accession number, aggregate custodial events or precedence relationships.*

Standing questions:

1. Modeling of custodial event type using the *rdf:type* property. Should the value of this property be a Custodial Event subclass (https://ld4p.github.io/arm/custodial_history/ontology/0.1/custodial_history.html#CustodialEvent) and how to enforce it in the profile. Can a subclass be used as a scheme for a property value?

2. arm:atLocation vs. bf:place. Seems the discussion is closed (https://github.com/LD4P/arm/issues/48), but not sure about the difference.

3. Activity subclasses. Does the sinopia RT Agents Contribution (https://github.com/LD4P/sinopia_sample_profiles/blob/master/profiles/v0.1.0/BIBFRAME%202.0%20Agents%20Contribution.json) work in this context? 

#### HRC ARM Bound-with test
*High level JSON profile for the ARM bound-with model. It doesn't include table of contents.*

Standing questions:

1. Is this the right way of linking to the item? Should an RT for bound-with item be created within this profile to include precedes and follows properties, and how would that link to the more generic item RT?

# Tips and tricks

### Atom packages installed

**Pretty-json** (https://atom.io/packages/pretty-json)  
The Sinopia Profile Editor exports not formated JSON files, which makes it hard to review on a text editor. This package allows to format the json file when opening it with Atom.


### Validating a profile in Command Promp using the Sinopia JSON schemasand AJV (Windows)

**AJV** (Another JSON Schema Validator) requires **Node.js** , so that would be the first step. 

1. Installed **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Installed **AJV** (https://ajv.js.org/) using command promp

`npm install -g ajv-cli`



3. Downloaded the **Sinopia JSON schemas v0.1.0** (https://ld4p.github.io/sinopia/schemas) to a local folder

4. In command promp typed:

`ajv validate -s [schemas_folder]/profile -r "[schemas_folder]/*.json" -d "[profiles_folder]/*.json"`



>`-s` --- indicates the JSON-schema to validate against (only takes one schema!).
>
>`-r` --- indicates all the referenced schemas (which would be the rest of the Sinopia JSON-schemas v0.1.0 downloaded to a local directory).
>
>`-d` --- indicates the JSON profiles (it takes multiple files, so the wild card will allow to validate all the profiles in the given folder).
