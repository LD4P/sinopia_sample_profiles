# Sinopia Profile files for the Ransom Center LD4P2 project

This directory includes HRC profiles being used on the stage environment. HRC's profiles use un-nested resource temaplates to facilitate data articulation and reuse. The **main profiles** correspond to different starting points for the description of the main Bibliographic entities represented in the Center's LD4P2 project. The **auxiliar profiles** correspond to all the relevant resource templates needed for the description of those bibliographic entities.
