# Harvard Library, Houghton Library Rare Materials/Incunables Sinopia Profiles

This page includes Sinopia Editor profiles and resource templates created and customized to support linked data description of incunables resources at the Houghton Library, Harvard University.  These profiles and resource templates were largely derived from the [LD4P set of core resource templates](https://github.com/LD4P/ld4ptemplates) and rare materials-specific profile and resource template work developed by Yale University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas.  The profiles and resource templates include BIBFRAME modeling based on Library of Congress profiles and integrates [Art and Rare Materials (ARM) BIBFRAME Ontology Extension](https://github.com/Art-and-Rare-Materials-BF-Ext/ARM-ontology/) modeling as needed.
