SinopiaConfigurationDemo is a content-less profile intended to show the various configuration possibilities for describing a Resource. This is a sample profile, content is meaningless, Resource URI = http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/Work; for literal examples, property URI = http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/copyrightDate; for lookup examples, property URI = http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/subject; for examples that point to another RT, property URI is http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe/note.

NOTE: SinopiaConfigurationDemo does not show any defaults, because that feature was not yet working at the time the demo profile was created. Also, the same property URI was used for multiple fields, which, for literals, can cause entered values to display in multiple fields when the Resource Template is used in the Linked Data Editor. For a demo Profile with defaults and a variety of property URIs, see subsequent configuration demo profiles.
